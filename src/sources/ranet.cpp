/*
  RA: fetching the watch list from the PC client while the OPL menu is up.

  rcheevos derives the watch list from the achievement set it downloads
  from the RetroAchievements server, and rcheevos cannot run on the PS2.
  So the console asks the PC client (xeRAbora) for the list that belongs to
  the image it is about to launch.

  This runs in the menu, where the full lwIP stack is still available.
  The bypass and hand-built frames belong to the in-game side; nothing
  of that kind is needed here.

  In Xerabora mode the request is a broadcast unless an RA companion IP
  is set; Caduceus first asks its session bridge (CADQ2, UDP 18197) on the
  companion or SMB host, then the engine on that same PC. While a UDPFS
  chain owns the NIC the same exchange runs through the ministack's
  mstack: device instead of a socket.

  Protocol (xeRAbora v0.1.0-alpha.15 protocol v1 with pointer chain extension):
    console -> "RAP1 <own-ip> <own-port>"                    (discovery)
    PC      -> "RAO1 OK <client>/<version>"
    console -> "RAQ1 <hash32> <serial> <own-ip> <own-port>"
    PC      -> "RAA1 OK <bytes> <chunks> [<achievements> <title>]",
               "RAA1 WAIT" or "RAA1 NO"
    console -> "RAG1 <hash32> <chunk-index> <own-ip> <own-port>"
    PC      -> "RAC1 <index> <length> " + binary data

  The console's own address and port are part of the request because
  the PC client may run inside Docker, where NAT rewrites the source
  address. A reply sent back to the apparent source goes to the Docker
  gateway and dies. The socket is therefore bound to the fixed port
  18196 and the PC replies to that address directly.

  The list travels in chunks: it can approach two kilobytes, and IP
  fragment reassembly on this stack is nothing to rely on.

  Why the receive path looks the way it does. recv/recvfrom are not
  local calls here: libc forwards them over SIF RPC to ps2ips.irx and
  the data comes back by a separate DMA. That layer has two delivery
  paths:

  - a packet LARGER than 64 bytes into a 64-byte-aligned buffer: the
    middle goes by direct SIF DMA into our buffer, the same reliable
    mechanism everything else in OPL uses;
  - a packet of 64 bytes or LESS (or unaligned edges): the bytes go
    into a side structure, rests_pkt, and the recv_intr callback copies
    them out at the end of the RPC. On real hardware this path produced
    "recvfrom returned 14, buffer full of zeros".

  The rules this file follows:
  1) rx_ is 64-byte aligned, so the "middle" starts at byte zero and
     arrives by direct DMA;
  2) the PC pads EVERY reply to a multiple of 64 and to at least 128
     bytes, so there is neither head nor tail for recv_intr and the
     small-packet path is never used;
  3) one reply is at most 960 bytes: the IOP side has 1024 bytes per
     call (BUFF_SIZE in ps2ips.c), receives at offset 64 for an aligned
     buffer, and a datagram longer than 992 would overflow the receive
     buffer. A list chunk is therefore 896 bytes:
     896 + header + padding = 960;
  4) from/fromlen are always passed even though unused: the EE recvfrom
     wrapper memcpys into from unconditionally, and NULL means a write
     to address zero.

  Upstream design and implementation: hacan359. Port notes for this fork:
  the menu's stack is ps2sdk lwIP behind the vendored ps2ips, so
  MSG_DONTWAIT is lwIP's 0x08 here -- the 0x40 in
  modules/network/common/smstcpip-common.h belongs to SMSTCPIP, the
  IN-GAME stack, which this file never talks to.

  This file compiles to nothing unless RETROACHIEVEMENTS=1.
